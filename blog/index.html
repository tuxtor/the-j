        <a href="../blog/2019/2019-04-17-Evaluating-Kotlin-caveats-JavaEE.html"><h1>The state of Kotlin for Jakarta EE/MicroProfile traditional applications</h1></a>
        <p>22 April 2019</p>
        <p><p><img src="/images/posts/kotlinee/kotlinee.png" alt="Kotlin EE" title="Kotlin EE Logo" /></p><p>This easter I had the opportunity to catch up with some R&amp;D tasks in my main Job, in short I had to evaluate the feasibility of using Kotlin in regular Jakarta EE/MicroProfile projects including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Language benefits</li>
  <li>Jakarta EE/MicroProfile API support, specifically CDI, JPA, JAX-RS</li>
  <li>Maven support</li>
  <li>Compatibility with my regular libraries (Flyway, SL4J, Arquillian)</li>
  <li>Regular application server support -e.g Payara-</li>
  <li>Tooling support (deployment, debugging, project import)</li>
  <li>Cloud deployment by Docker</li>
</ul><h2>TL;DR version</h2><p>Kotlin works as language and plays well with Maven, I'm able to use many of the EE API for "services", however the roadblock is not the language or libraries, is the tooling support.</p><p><strong>The experience is superb on IntelliJ IDEA and all works as expected, however the IDE is a barrier if you're not an IntelliJ user</strong>, Kotlin doesn't play well with WTP on Eclipse (hence it doesn't deploy to app servers) and Kotlin support for Netbeans is mostly dead.</p><h2>About language</h2><p>If you have a couple of years in the JVM space you probably remember that <strong>Scala, Ceylon and Kotlin have been considered as better Javas</strong>. I do a lot of development in different languages including Java for backends, Kotlin for mobile, JavaScript on front-ends, Bash for almost every automation task so I knew the streghts of Kotlin from the mobile space where is specially important, basically most of the Java development on Android is currently a Java 7+Lambdas experience.</p><p>My top three features that could help you in your EE tasks are<br/>* One line functions<br/>* Public by default<br/>* Multiline Strings<br/>* Companion objects<br/>* Type inference</p><p>I'll try to exemplify these in a regular application</p><h2>The Jakarta EE/MicroProfile application</h2><p>The demo application follows a simple structure, it includes MicroProfile Config, CDI, EJB, JPA, and JAX-RS, focused on a simple phrase collector/retrieval service. Interesting Kotlin features are highlighted.</p><p>Source code is available at GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/tuxtor/integrum-ee">https://github.com/tuxtor/integrum-ee</a>.</p><h3>Project configuration</h3><p>To enable Kotlin support I basically followed <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html">Kotlin's Maven guide</a>, is not so explanatory but if you have a litle bit of experience in maven this won't be a problem.</p><p>Besides adding Kotlin dependencies to a regular EE <code>pom.xml</code>a special configuration is needed for the <code>all-open</code> plugin, Jakarta EE works with proxy entities that inherit from your original code. To make it simple all CDI, EJB and JAX-RS important annotations were included as "open activators".</p>

&lt;/plugin&gt;
</code></pre><h3>Model</h3><p>Table models are easily created by using Kotlin's Data Classes, note the default values on parameters and nullable types for autogenerated values, using an incrementable value on a table.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@Entity
@Table(name = &quot;adm_phrase&quot;)
@TableGenerator(name = &quot;admPhraseIdGenerator&quot;, table = &quot;adm_sequence_generator&quot;, pkColumnName = &quot;id_sequence&quot;, valueColumnName = &quot;sequence_value&quot;, pkColumnValue = &quot;adm_phrase&quot;, allocationSize = 1)
data class AdmPhrase(
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = &quot;admPhraseIdGenerator&quot;)
        @Column(name = &quot;phrase_id&quot;)
        var phraseId:Long? = null,
        var author:String = &quot;&quot;,
        var phrase:String = &quot;&quot;
)
</code></pre><p>After that, I need to provide also a repository, the repository is a classic CRUD component injectable with CDI, one line methods are created to make the repository concise. The interesting part however is that Kotlin's nullability system plays well with CDI by using <code>lateinit</code>.</p><p>The most pleasant part is to create JPQL querys with multiline declarations, In general I dislike the + signs polluting my query in Java :).</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@RequestScoped
class AdmPhraseRepository @Inject constructor() {

    @Inject
    private lateinit var em:EntityManager

    @PostConstruct
    fun init() {
        println (&quot;Booting repository&quot;)
    }

    fun create(admPhrase:AdmPhrase) = em.persist(admPhrase)

    fun update(admPhrase:AdmPhrase) = em.merge(admPhrase)

    fun findById(phraseId: Long) = em.find(AdmPhrase::class.java, phraseId)

    fun delete(admPhrase: AdmPhrase) = em.remove(admPhrase)

    fun listAll(author: String, phrase: String): List&lt;AdmPhrase&gt; {

        val query = &quot;&quot;&quot;SELECT p FROM AdmPhrase p
            where p.author LIKE :author
            and p.phrase LIKE :phrase
        &quot;&quot;&quot;

        return em.createQuery(query, AdmPhrase::class.java)
                .setParameter(&quot;author&quot;, &quot;%$author%&quot;)
                .setParameter(&quot;phrase&quot;, &quot;%$phrase%&quot;)
                .resultList
    }

}
</code></pre><h3>Controller</h3><p>The model needs to by exposed by using a controller, hence a JAX-RS activator is needed</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@ApplicationPath(&quot;/rest&quot;)
class RestApplication : Application()
</code></pre><p>That's all the code.</p><p>On the other side, implementing the controller looks a lot more like Java, specially if the right HTTP codes are needed. In this line to express the Java class to the builders the special Kotlin syntax <code>this::class.java</code> is mandatory.</p><p>Is also observed the elvis operator in action (in DELETE), if the entity is not found the alternative return is fired immediately, a nice idiomatic resource.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@Path(&quot;/phrases&quot;)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
class AdmPhraseController{

    @Inject
    private lateinit var admPhraseRepository: AdmPhraseRepository

    @Inject
    private lateinit var logger: Logger

    @GET
    fun findAll(@QueryParam(&quot;author&quot;) @DefaultValue(&quot;%&quot;) author: String,
                @QueryParam(&quot;phrase&quot;) @DefaultValue(&quot;%&quot;) phrase: String) =
                admPhraseRepository.listAll(author, phrase)

    @GET
    @Path(&quot;/{id:[0-9][0-9]*}&quot;)
    fun findById(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) id:Long) = admPhraseRepository.findById(id)

    @PUT
    fun create(phrase: AdmPhrase): Response {
        admPhraseRepository.create(phrase)
        return Response.created(UriBuilder.fromResource(this::class.java)
                .path(phrase.phraseId.toString()).build()).build()
    }

    @POST
    @Path(&quot;/{id:[0-9][0-9]*}&quot;)
    fun update(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) id: Long?, phrase: AdmPhrase): Response {
        if(id != phrase.phraseId) return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build()

        val updatedEntity = admPhraseRepository.update(phrase)
        return Response.ok(updatedEntity).build()
    }

    @DELETE
    @Path(&quot;/{id:[0-9][0-9]*}&quot;)
    fun delete(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) id: Long): Response {

            return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build()
        admPhraseRepository.delete(updatedEntity)
        return Response.ok().build()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>To try MicroProfile a second controller is created that tries to read JAVA_HOME</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@Path(&quot;/hello&quot;)
class HelloController{

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name =&quot;JAVA_HOME&quot;, defaultValue = &quot;JAVA_HOME&quot;)
    lateinit var javaHome:String

    @GET
    fun doHello() = &quot;There is no place like $javaHome&quot;

}
</code></pre><h3>Utilities</h3><p>To create a real test, four "advanced components" were included, being an entity manager producer for CDI components, a Flyway bootstrapper with <code>@Startup</code> EJB, a Log producer for SL4J, and a "simple" test with Arquillian.</p><p>The producer itself is pretty similar to its Java equivalent, it only takes advantage of one line methods.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@ApplicationScoped
class EntityManagerProducer {

    @PersistenceUnit
    private lateinit var entityManagerFactory: EntityManagerFactory

    @Produces
    @Default
    @RequestScoped
    fun create(): EntityManager = this.entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager()

    fun dispose(@Disposes @Default entityManager: EntityManager) {
        if (entityManager.isOpen) {
            entityManager.close()
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The Flyway migration is implemented with EJB to fire it every time that this application is deployed (and of course to test EJB). Since Kotlin doesn't have a try-with-resources structure the resource management is implemented with a <code>let</code> block, making it really readable. Besides this if there is a problem the data source it will be null and <code>let</code> block won't be executed.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@ApplicationScoped
@Singleton
@Startup
class FlywayBootstrapper{

    @Inject
    private lateinit var logger:Logger

    @Throws(EJBException::class)
    @PostConstruct
    fun init() {

        val ctx = InitialContext()
        val dataSource = ctx.lookup(&quot;java:app/jdbc/integrumdb&quot;) as? DataSource

        dataSource.let {
            val flywayConfig = Flyway.configure()
                    .dataSource(it)
                    .locations(&quot;db/postgresql&quot;)

            val flyway = flywayConfig.load()
            val migrationInfo = flyway.info().current()

            if (migrationInfo == null) {
                logger.info(&quot;No existing database at the actual datasource&quot;)
            }
            else {
                logger.info(&quot;Found a database with the version: ${migrationInfo.version} : ${migrationInfo.description}&quot;)
            }

            flyway.migrate()
            logger.info(&quot;Successfully migrated to database version: {}&quot;, flyway.info().current().version)
            it?.connection?.close()
        }
        ctx.close()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>To create a non empty-database a PostgreSQL migration was created at <code>db/postgresql</code> in project resources.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.adm_sequence_generator (
    id_sequence VARCHAR(75) DEFAULT &#39;&#39; NOT NULL,
    sequence_value BIGINT DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,

    fun produceLog(injectionPoint: InjectionPoint): Logger =

}
</code></pre><p>Finally a test class is also implemented, since Kotlin doesn't have static methods a companion object with @JvmStatic annotation is created on the class, otherwise test won't be executed. This is probably one of the examples where Kotlin's program get bigger if compared to Java equivalent.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@RunWith(Arquillian::class)

</code></pre><h2>Testing the application with IntelliJ IDEA and Payara 5</h2><p>If the application is executed/debugged on IntelliJ IDEA all works as expected, sincerely I wasn't expecting an easy road but this worked really well.

</code></pre><p>After that, Invoking the compose file will bring the application+infrastructure to life. Now it's time to test it on a real cloud. First the image is published to Oracle's Container Registry</p><p><img src="/images/posts/kotlinee/ocs.png" alt="Oracle Container Registry" title="Oracle Container Registry" /></p><p>Once the container is available at Oracle Cloud the image become usable for any kind of orchestation, for simplicity I'm running directly the compose file over a bare CentOS VM image (the Wercker+Docker+Kubernetes is an entirely different tutorial).</p><p><img src="/images/posts/kotlinee/registry.png" alt="Oracle Container Registry" title="Oracle Container Registry" /></p><p>To use it on Oracle's infrasctructure, the image ID should be switched to the full name <code>image: iad.ocir.io/tuxtor/microprofile/integrum-ee:1</code>, in the end the image is pulled, and the final result is our Kotlin EE application running over Oracle Cloud.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/kotlinee/oracle-cloud.png" alt="Oracle Cloud" title="Oracle Cloud" /></p><h2>Testing the application with NetBeans</h2><p>JetBrains <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-netbeans">dropped Kotlin support for NetBeans in 2017</a>, I tried the plugin just for fun on NetBeans 11 but it hangs Netbeans startup while loading Kotlin support, so NetBeans tests were not possible.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/kotlinee/kotlinnetbeans.png" alt="Kotlin NetBeans" title="Kotlin NetBeans" /></p><h2>Testing the application with Eclipse for Java EE</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse">JetBeans currently develops a Kotlin complement</a> for Eclipse and seems to work fine with pure Kotlin projects, however the history is very different for Jakarta EE.</p><p>After importing the Maven project (previously created in IntelliJ IDEA) many default <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/topic/org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.doc.user/topics/cfacets.html">facets</a> are included in the project, being CDI the most problematic, it takes a lot of time to build the project in the CDI builder step.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/kotlinee/cdisleep.png" alt="CDI slow" title="CDI slow" /></p><p>Besides that, Jakarta EE complements/parsers work over the code and not the class files, hence the "advanced" menus don't show content, a very cosmetic detail anyway. If Kotlin sources are located under <code>src/main/kotlin</code> as suggested by JetBrains Maven guide, these are ignored by default. Hence, I took the easy road and moved all the code to <code>src/main/java</code>.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/kotlinee/facets.png" alt="Eclipse facets" title="Eclipse facets" /></p><p>Kotlin syntax highlighting works fine, as expected from any language on Eclipse.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/kotlinee/kotlineclipse.png" alt="Kotlin syntax" title="Kotlin syntax" /></p><p>However if you try to deploy the application it simply doesn't work because Eclipse compiler does not produce the class file for Kotlin source files, <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KE-57?p=KT-14838">a bug was raised in 2017</a> and many <a href="https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/eclipse-maven-m2e-wtp-with-kotlin/2604">other users report issues with Tomcat and Wildfly</a>. Basically <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">Eclipse WTP</a> is not compatible with Kotlin and deployment/debugging Kotlin code won't work over an application server.</p><h2>Final considerations</h2><p>At the end I was a little dissapointed, <strong>Kotlin has great potential for Jakarta EE but it works only if you use IntelliJ IDEA</strong>. I'm not sure about IntelliJ CE but as stated in JetBrains website, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/buy/">EE support is only included on Ultimate Edition</a>, maybe this could be changed with more community involvemente but I'm not sure if this is the right direction considering <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/">project Amber</a>.</p></p>

        <p>19 December 2018</p>
        <p><p><img src="/images/posts/ejmicro/cover.png" alt="Enterprise Java Microservices cover" title="Enterprise Java Microservices" /></p><h2>General information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pages: 245</li>
  <li>Published by: Manning</li>
  <li>Release date: nov 2018</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Disclaimer: I received this book as a collaboration with Manning and the author.</p>
</blockquote><h2>Some context on learning Microservices</h2><p>Let's clarify one thing, switching from Monoliths to Microservices is not like switching from traditional JavaEE to Spring (and viceversa), <strong>is more like learning to develop software again</strong> because you have to learn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New architectural patterns</li>
  <li>How to work with distributed transactions</li>
  <li>How to guarantee consistency in distributed data (or not)</li>
  <li>New plumbing/management tools like Docker, Kubernets, Pipelines</li>
  <li>New frameworks and/or old frameworks with new Cloud Native capabilities</li>
</ul><p>Despite really good publications like the <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 factors for web native applications</a>. <strong>From my perspective the real challenge on learning Microservices is the lack of a central documentation/tutorial/from 0 to wow guide.</strong></p><p>In the old days, if you wanted to learn enterprise software development on Java, you simply took the Java EE tutorial from 0 to 100, maybe a second tutorial like <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/ticket-monster/">Ticket Monster</a>, a couple of reference books and that's it. However, learning Microservices is more like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learning new cloud native capabilities of old frameworks in documentations that take for granted your knowledge of previous versions of the framework</li>
  <li>Or learning new frameworks with words like reactive, functional, non-blocking, bazinga</li>
  <li>Learning new design patterns without knowing the real motivation of each pattern</li>
  <li>Surfing in a lot of reddit and StackOverflow discussions on not-so clear explanations</li>
  <li>Learning Docker and Kubernets because every body is doing it</li>
  <li>Hitting end roads because you are accustomed to things like JNDI, JTA, Stateful sessions</li>
</ul><h2>About the book</h2><p>Do you see the problem? The lack of a cohesive guide that explains who, how and why you need the zillion of new tools makes the path of learning Microservices an uphill battle, and that's where <strong>Enterprise Java Microservices</strong> shines.</p><p>Enterprise Java Microservices is one of the <strong>first attempts to create a cohesive guide with special focus on Java EE developers and MicroProfile</strong>. The book is divided in two main sections, the first one focused on Microservice basics (my favorite) and the second one focused on Microservices implementations with specific libraries (being a little bit biased for Red Hat Solutions).</p><h3>First section</h3><p><strong>For those that already have some Enterprise Java knowledge but don't have too much idea about the new challenges in the Microservice world this will be the most useful section</strong>, with your actual knowledge you should be able to understand:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main differences between monoliths and microservices architectural styles and patterns, this is by far the most important section for me and gave me a couple of new ideas debunking some misconceptions that I had</li>
  <li>Just Enough and Micro application servers/frameworks</li>
  <li>New jargon on the cloud native world (yup you have to learn a lot of new acronyms)</li>
  <li>General knowledge on testing Microservices</li>
  <li>Why do you need new tools like service discovery, service registry, gateways, etc.</li>
  <li>Principles of reactive applications</li>
</ul><p>This section also includes a brief introduction to API/Rest Web Services creation with Java EE and Spring, however I'm not sure about the feeling of this section for a newcomer.</p><h3>Second section</h3><p>Once you took the basis from the first section (or from bad implementations and end roads in the real life like me), this section will cover three of the most complex and important topics in Microservices, being:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Service discovery and load balancing</li>
  <li>Fault tolerance (circuit breakers, bulkheads, etc.)</li>
  <li>Strategies for management and monitoring microservices</li>
</ol><p><strong>The chapters of the second section are structured in a way that makes easier to understand why do you need the "topic" that you are about to learn</strong>, however and despite being early focused on MicroProfile, it will use specific libraries like Hystrix, Ribbon and Feing (yes, like in Spring Boot) for the implementation of these patterns, adding also some specific integrations with Thorntail.</p><p>Later on, the book evolves over a sample application, covering topics like security, architectures with Docker/Kubernets and data streams processing, where as I said a particular bias is present, implementing the solutions by using Minishift, Keycloack and other Red Hat specifics.</p><p>To clarify, <strong>I don't think that this bias is bad, considering that there are (as I said) a zillion of alternatives for <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2018/sessions/build-12-factor-microservice-using-microprofile">those factors not covered by Java</a></strong>, I think it was the right decision.</p><h2>Things that could be better</h2><p>As any review this is the most difficult section to write, but I think that a second edition should include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MicroProfile fault tolerance</li>
  <li>MicroProfile type safe clients</li>
</ul><p>Since Ken is one of the guys behind MicroProfile implementation in Red Hat, I'm guessing that the main motivation for not including it is simple, MicroProfile is evolving so fast that these standards were presented after book printing.</p><p>People looking for data consistency patterns (CQRS, Event Sourcing, eventual consistency, etc.) could find the streaming processing section a little smaller than it should be.</p><h2>Who should read this book?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Java developers with strong foundations, or experience in Spring or Java EE</li>
</ul><p>Yes, despite their coverage of basic APIs, I think that you need foundations like those covered in OCP certification, otherwise you will be confused in the implementation of annotations, callbacks, declarative and imperative code.</p></p>
        <a href="../blog/2018/2018-10-31-Eclipse-Metrics-Usecases.html"><h1>Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics, practical use cases</h1></a>
        <p>31 October 2018</p>
        <p><h2>Background</h2><p>At the end of 2000 decade, one of the main motivations for DevOps creation was the (relatively speaking) neglected interaction between development, QA and operations teams.</p><p>In this line, <strong>the "DevOps promise" could be summarized as the union between culture, practices and tools</strong> to improve software quality and, at the same time, to speed up software development teams in terms of time to market. Winning in many successful implementations colateral effects like scalability, stability, security and development speed.</p><p>In line with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/">diverse opinions</a>, to implement a successful DevOps culture IT teams need to implement practices like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuos integration (CI)</li>
  <li>Continuos delivery (CD)</li>
  <li>MicroServices</li>
  <li>Infrastructure as code</li>
  <li>Communication and collaboration</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring and metrics</strong></li>
</ul><p>In this world of <strong>buzzwords</strong> it's indeed difficult to identify the DevOps maturity state without losing the final goal: <strong>To create applications that generate value for the customer in short periods of time</strong>.</p><p>In this post, we will discuss about monitoring and metrics in the Java Enterprise World, specially how the new DevOps practices impact the architectural decision at the technology selection phase.</p><h2>Metrics in Java monoliths</h2><p>If traditional architectures are considered, monolithic applications hold common characteristics like:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Execution over servlet containers and application servers, with the JVM being a <strong>long running</strong> process.</li>
  <li>Ideally, these containers are never rebooted, or reboots are allowed on planned maintenance Windows.</li>
  <li>An application could compromise the integrity of the entire monolith under several conditions like bad code, bad deployments and server issues.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Without considering any Java framework, the deployment structure will be similar to the figure</strong>. In here we observe that applications are distributed by using .war or .jar files, being collected in .ear files for management purposes. In these architectures applications are created as modules, and separated considering its business objectives.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/monolith.png" alt="Monolith deployment" /></p><p>If a need to scale appears, there are basically two options, <strong>1- to scale server resources (vertical) and 2- to add more servers with an application copy to distribute clients using a load balancer</strong>. It is worth to notice that new nodes tend to be also <strong>long running</strong> processes, since any application server reboot implies a considerable amount of time that is directly proportional to the quantity of applications that have been deployed.</p><p>Hence, the decision to provision (or not) a new application server often is a combined decision between development and operations teams, and with this you have the following options to monitor the state of your applications and application server:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Vendor or vendor-neutral telemetric APIs -e.g <a href="https://jolokia.org/">Jookla</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/glassfishmm-2082439.html">Glassfish REST Metrics</a>-</li>
  <li>JMX monitoring through specific tools and ports -e.g. <a href="https://visualvm.github.io/">VisualVM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JDKMissionControl/jmc">Mission Control</a>-</li>
  <li>"Shell wrangling" with tail, sed, cat, top and htop</li>
</ol><p>It should be noticed also, in this kind of deployments it's necessary to obtain metrics from <strong>application and server</strong>, creating a complex scenario for status monitoring.</p><p>The <em>rule of thumb</em> for this scenarios is often to choose telemetric/own APIs to monitor application state and JMX/Logs for a deeper analysis of runtime situation, again presenting more questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which telemetric API should I choose? Do I need a specific format?</li>
  <li>Server's telemetry would be sufficient? How metrics will be processed?</li>
  <li>How do I got access to JMX in my deployments if I'm a Containers/PaaS user?</li>
</ul><h2>Reactive applications</h2><p><strong>One of the (not so) recent approaches to improve users experience is to implement reactive systems</strong> with the defined principles of the <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Manifesto</a>.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/reactive-traits.png" alt="Reactive manifesto" /></p><p>In short, a reactive system is a system capable of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Being directed/activated by messages often processed asynchronously</li>
  <li>Presents resilience by failing partially, without compromising all the system</li>
  <li>Is elastic to provision and halt modules and resources on demand, having a direct impact in resources billing</li>
  <li>The final result is a responsive system for the user</li>
</ul><p>Despite not being discussed so often, <strong>reactive architectures have a direct impact on metrics</strong>. With dynamic provisioning you won't have long running processes to attach and save metrics, and additionally the services are switching ip addresses depending on clients demand.</p><h2>Metrics in Java Microservices architectures</h2><p>Without considering any particular framework or library, the reactive architectural style puts as <strong>strong suggestion</strong> the usage of containers and/or Microservice, specially for resilience and elasticity:</p><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/microservices.png" alt="Microservices deployment" /></p><p>In a traditional Microservices architecture we observe that services are basically short-lived "workers", which could have clones reacting to changes on clients demand. These environments are often orchestrated with tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, hence each service is responsable of register themself to a service registry acting as a directory. Being the registry, the ideal source for any metric tool to read services location, <strong>pulling and saving the correspondent metrics</strong>.</p><h2>Metrics with Java EE and Eclipse MicroProfile</h2><p>Despite the early efforts on the EE space like <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=77">an administrative API with metrics</a>, the need of a formal standard for metrics became mandatory due Microservices popularization. Being <strong><a href="https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/">Dropwizard Metrics</a> one of the pioneers to cover the need of a telemetric toolkit with <a href="https://github.com/astefanutti/metrics-cdi">specific CDI extensions</a></strong>.</p><p>In this line, the MicroProfile project has included among its recent versions(1.4 and 2.0) support for Healthcheck and state Metrics. <strong>Many of the current DropWizard users would notice that annotations are similar if not the same. In fact MicroProfile annotations are based directly on DropWizard's <a href="https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/spec/src/main/asciidoc/app-programming-model.adoc">API 3.2.3</a></strong>.</p><p>To differentiate between concepts, Healtheck API is in charge of answering a simple question "Is the service running and how well is it doing it?" and are targeted for orchestrations. On the other side Metrics present instant or periodical metrics on how services are reacting over consumers requests.</p><p>Latest version of MicroProfile (2.0) includes support for Metrics 1.1, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Counted</li>
  <li>Gauge</li>
  <li>Metered</li>
  <li>Timed</li>
  <li>Histogram</li>
</ul><p>So, it is worth to <strong>give them a try with practical use cases</strong>.</p><h2>Metrics with Payara and Eclipse MicroProfile</h2><p>For the test we will use an application composed by two microservices, as described in the diagram:</p><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/demomicro.png" alt="Arquitectura tests" /></p><p><strong>Our scenario includes two microservices, OmdbService focused on information retrieving from <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDB</a> to obtain up to date movie information and MovieService aimed to obtain movie information from a relational database and mix it with OMDB plot</strong>. Projects code is available at GitHub.</p>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/tuxtor/omdb-demo">https://github.com/tuxtor/omdb-demo</a></li>
</ul><p>To activate support for MicroProfile 2.0 two things are needed, 1- the right dependency on pom.xml and 2- to deploy/run our application over a MicroProfile compatible implementation, like Payara Micro.</p>
<pre><code class="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.microprofile&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;microprofile&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;2.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre><p>MicroProfile uses a basic convention in regards of metrics, presenting three levels:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Base:</strong> Mandatory Metrics for all MicroProfile implementations, located at <code>/metrics/base</code></li>
  <li><strong>Application:</strong> Custom metrics exposed by the developer, located at <code>/metrics/application</code></li>
  <li><strong>Vendor:</strong> Any MicroProfile implementation could implement its own variant, located at <code>/metrics/vendor</code></li>
</ol><p>Depending on requests header, metrics will be available in JSON or <a href="https://openmetrics.io/">OpenMetrics</a> format. The last one popularized by Prometheus, a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2018/08/09/prometheus-graduates/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation project</a>.</p><h2>Practical use cases</h2><p>So far, we've established that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You could monitor your Java application by using telemetric APIs and JMX</li>
  <li>Reactive applications present new challenges, specially due microservices dynamic and short running nature</li>
  <li>JMX is sometimes difficult to implement on container/PaaS based deployments</li>
  <li>MicroProfile Metrics is a new proposal for Java(Jakarta) EE environments, working indistinctly for monoliths and microservices architectures</li>
</ol><p>In this post we present a couple of cases discussed also at Oracle Code One:</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUiXJWDy_g0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h3>Case 0: Telemetry from JVM</h3><p>To give a quick look on MicroProfile metrics, it is enough to boot a MicroProfile compliant app server/microservice framework with any deployment. Since Payara Micro is compatible with Microprofile, <strong>metrics will be available from the beginning</strong> at <code>http://localhost:8080/metrics/base</code>.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/base-metrics.png" alt="Base metrics" /></p><p>You could switch the <strong>Accept request header</strong> in order to obtain JSON format, in curl for instance:</p>
<pre><code>curl -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot; http://localhost:8080/metrics/base
</code></pre><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/json-metrics.png" alt="JSON metrics" /></p><p>By itself metrics are just an <strong>up to date snapshot</strong> about platform state. If you wanna compare these snapshots over time, metrics should be retrieved on constant periods of time . . . or you could integrate prometheus which already does it for you. In here I demonstrate some useful querys for JVM state, including heap state, cpu utilization and GC executions:</p>
<pre><code>base:memory_used_heap_bytes
</code></pre><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/metrics-heap.png" alt="Heap metrics" /></p>
<pre><code>base:cpu_system_load_average
</code></pre><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/metrics-cpu.png" alt="CPU metrics" /></p>
<pre><code>base:gc_ps_mark_sweep_count
</code></pre><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/metrics-gc.png" alt="GC metrics" /></p><h3>Case 1: Metrics for Microservices</h3><p>In a regular and "full tolerant" request from one microservice to another your communication flow will go through the following decisions:</p><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/fallpattern.png" alt="Metrics fallback patterns" /></p>
<ol>
  <li>To use or not a cache to attend the request</li>
  <li>To cut the communication (circuit breaker) and execute a fallback method if a metric threshold has been reached</li>
  <li>To reject the request if a bulkhead has been exhausted and execute a fallback method instead</li>
  <li>To execute a fallback method if the execution reached a failed state</li>
</ol><p>Many of the caveats on developing Microservices come from the fact that you are dealing with distributed computation, hence you should include new patterns that already depend on metrics. If metrics are being generated, with exposure you will gain data for improvements, diagnosis and issue management.</p><h4>Case 1.1: Counted to retrieve failed hits</h4><p>The first metric to implement will be Counted, a pretty simple one actually. Its main objective is to increment/decrement its value over time. <strong>In this use case the metric is counting how many times the service reached the fallBack alternative</strong> by injecting it directly on a JAX-RS service:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@Inject
@Metric
Counter failedQueries;
...
@GET
@Path(&quot;/{id:[a-z]*[0-9][0-9]*}&quot;)
@Fallback(fallbackMethod = &quot;findByIdFallBack&quot;)
@Timeout(TIMEOUT)
public Response findById(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) 
final String imdbId) {
...
}

public Response findByIdFallBack(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) 
final String imdbId) {
	...
	failedQueries.inc();
}
</code></pre><p>After simulating a couple of failed queries over OMDB database (no internet :) ) the metric <code>application:com_nabenik_omdb_rest_omdb_endpoint_failed_queries</code> shows how many times my service has invoked the fallback method:</p><p><img src="/images/posts/metrics/counted-metrics.png" alt="Counted metrics" /></p><h4>Case 1.2: Gauge to create your own metric</h4><p>Although you could depend on simple counters to describe the state of any given service. With gauge you could create your own metric . . . like a dummy metric to display 100 or 50 depending on odd/even random number:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">@Gauge(unit = &quot;ExternalDatabases&quot;, name = &quot;movieDatabases&quot;, absolute = true)
public long getDatabases() {
	int number = (int)(Math.random() * 100);

	MetricType.HISTOGRAM);
	Histogram histogram = 
	registry.histogram(metadata);
	histogram.update(attendees);
	return Response.ok().build();
}

        <p>22 August 2018</p>
        <p><p><img src="/images/posts/bestjob/cover.jpg" alt="Best Developer Job Ever! cover" title="Best Developer Job Ever" /></p><h2>General information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pages: 95</li>
  <li>Published by: Amazon Digital Services LLC</li>
  <li>Release date: july 2018</li>
</ul><h2>About the author</h2><p>I should start this review with a personal comment about the author, <a href="https://twitter.com/brjavaman">Bruno</a> as many Java developers know is one of the most influential leaders in the Java community, being in my case one of the people that adviced me to create a <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java/2016-duke%E2%80%99s-choice-award-winners">Duke's Choice Award winner</a> project. Hence when he announced the release of his developers advisory book, It went directly to my reading list.</p><h2>About the book</h2><p>Different from some motivational books that I've read, this book is focused in just one topic with a practical approach:</p>
<blockquote><p>How do I improve my professional carreer as software developer?</p>
</blockquote><p>For a regular book reader it will be a very short book, it took me 3 hours to complete the book from start to end.</p><p>The book is divided in five main sections:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get clarity on your strengths</li>
  <li>Define your objectives</li>
  <li>(How to) Expand your network</li>
  <li>Promote yourself (in the right way)</li>
  <li>Get quality interviews</li>
</ol><p>From reading just the section titles, readers could be tempted to guess that this book is focused on boosting any professional carreer, however each section and advice is tailored to IT following an evolutive approach:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any advice starts with an argumentative step, presenting diverse paths to reach the same professional objective in IT and specially in software development</li>
  <li>After argumentation and based in author's real world experience, some advices are presented to choose the best path and take advantage of it in a productive way</li>
  <li>Finally, some tools, tips and techniques are presented and complemented with various success histories to validate the tips (whick I must say, I know them to be true)</li>
</ul><h2>Room for improvement</h2><p>The main caveat for this book is that isn't available in other languages. I also noticed that despite presenting many usefull advices, it lacks of some diagrams to re-read the tips and act also as a developers carreer manual.</p><p>For the non-casual readers, the writting style could be interpreted as too informal or not so literary. As is, the book is written as an informal conversation between peers and it's a little bit repetitive while trying to emphasize some important points. It depends on readers background.</p><h2>Who should read this book?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Any IT professional, specialy software developers</li>
  <li>IT recruiters, it will give serious advices of how software development world works</li>
</ul><p>To finish the review, I think that the following excerpt contains the spirit of the book</p>
<blockquote><p>People can be givers or takers. The givers come in and bring things others can benefit from while the takers take more than they give and ultimately drag the network down by trying to benefit themselves. Thatâs why givers tend to grow more than takers or matchers.</p>

        <p>30 July 2018</p>
        <p><p>Today one of my favourite open source projects got a major release, now under Apache Foundation, welcome back NetBeans!.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/TheASF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheASF</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/netbeans?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NetBeans</a> community is proud to announce the 1st official release of <a href="https://twitter.com/TheASF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheASF</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/netbeans?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NetBeans</a> (incubating): <a href="https://t.co/GJLsExeWXO">https://t.co/GJLsExeWXO</a> Especially for devs, users, and students of JDK 8, 9, and 10. 100% free and open source and we welcome pull requests: <a href="https://t.co/AT39k8NCnO">https://t.co/AT39k8NCnO</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ae70AyqiGp">pic.twitter.com/Ae70AyqiGp</a></p>&mdash; Apache NetBeans (incubating) (@netbeans) <a href="https://twitter.com/netbeans/status/1023647803116015616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>In this line, I think that the most frequent question since beta release is:</p>
<blockquote><p>What about Java EE/C++/PHP/JavaME . . .? You name it</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Quick response:</strong></p><p><strong>First source code donation to Apache includes only base NetBeans platform</strong> modules plus Java SE support</p><p><strong>Long response:</strong></p><p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/entry/announce-apache-netbeans-incubating-92">Please see Apache Foundation official statement</a>.</p><h2>Does it mean that I won't be able to develop my Java EE application on NetBeans 9</h2><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> No</p><p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Currently Oracle already did a second donation, where most of NetBeans modules considered as external are included, as Apache statement suggests we could expect these modules on future NetBeans releases.</p><h2>Is it possible to enable Java EE support in NetBeans 9?</h2><p>Considering that NetBeans has been modular since . . . ever, we could expect support for old modules in the new NetBeans version. As a matter of fact, <strong>this is the official approach to enable Java EE support on NetBeans 9</strong>, <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/entry/what-s-happened-to-my">by using kits</a>.</p><p>Hence I've prepared a small tutorial to achieve this. This tutorial is focused on MacOS but steps should be exactly the same for Linux and Windows. To show some caveats, I've tested two app server over Java 8 and Java 10.</p><h3>Downloading NetBeans 9.0</h3><p>First, you should download NetBeans package from official Apache Mirrors, at this time distributions are only available as .zip files.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/nb9-download.png" alt="NetBeans 9 Download" title="NetBeans 9 download" /></p><p>After download, just uncompress the .zip file</p>
<pre><code class="bash">unzip incubating-netbeans-java-9.0-bin.zip
</code></pre><p>You should find a netbeans executable at <code>bin/</code> directory, for Unix:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">cd netbeans
bin/netbeans
</code></pre><p>Whit this you would be able to run NetBeans 9. <strong>By default, NetBeans will run on the most up-to date JVM available at system.</strong></p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/nb9.png" alt="NetBeans 9" title="NetBeans 9" /></p><h3>Enabling Java EE support</h3><p>To install Java EE support you should enable also NetBeans 8.2 update center repository.</p><p>First go to <code>Tools &gt; Plugins &gt; Settings</code>.</p><p>Second, add a new update repository:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://updates.netbeans.org/netbeans/updates/8.2/uc/final/distribution/catalog.xml.gz">http://updates.netbeans.org/netbeans/updates/8.2/uc/final/distribution/catalog.xml.gz</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML5 Kit</li>
  <li>JSF</li>
  <li>SOAP Web Services</li>
  <li>EJB and EAR</li>
  <li>RESTful Web Services</li>
  <li>Java EE Base</li>
</ul><p>Restart the IDE and you're ready to develop apps with Java EE :).</p><h2>Test 1: Wildfly 13</h2><p>To test NetBeans setup, I added a new application server and ran a recent Java EE 8 REST-CRUD application, <a href="https://github.com/comunidad-hispana-jugs/workshop-03-JEE8_-_JSE10/blob/master/JEE_8/README.md">from recent jEspaÃ±ol presentation</a> (in Spanish).</p><p>You have to select WildFly Application Server</p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/wf1.png" alt="WildFly 13" title="WildFly 13" /></p><p>As <a href="http://wildfly.org/news/2018/05/30/WildFly13-Final-Released/">WildFly release notes</a> suggests if you wanna Java EE 8 support, you should choose <code>standalone-ee8.xml</code> as domain configuration.<br/><img src="/images/posts/nb9/wf2.png" alt="WildFly 13" title="WildFly 13" /></p><p>Domain configuration will be detected by NetBeans 9</p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/wf3.png" alt="WildFly 13" title="WildFly 13" /></p><p>WildFly team has been working on Java 9 and 10 compatibility, hence application ran as expected delivering new records from in-memory database.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/wf4.png" alt="WildFly 13" title="WildFly 13" /></p><h2>Test 2: Glassfish 5 and Payara 5 on Java 10 (NetBeans) and Java 8 (App server platform)</h2><p>To test vanilla experience, I tried to connect Payara and Glassfish 5 app server, as in the case of WildFly, configuration is pretty straight forward:</p><p>You have to select Payara Application Server<br/><img src="/images/posts/nb9/py1.png" alt="Payara 5" title="Payara 5" /></p><p>Domain 1 default configuration should be ok<br/><img src="/images/posts/nb9/py2.png" alt="Payara 5" title="Payara 5" /></p><p>Since Payara and Glassfish only support Java 8 (<a href="https://blog.payara.fish/payara-server-and-payara-micro-in-2018">Java 11 support is on the roadmap</a>) you have to create a new platform with Java 8. Go to <code>Tools -&gt; Java Platforms</code> and click on <code>Add Platform</code><br/><img src="/images/posts/nb9/py3.png" alt="Payara 5" title="Payara 5" /></p><p>Select a new Java SE Platform</p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/py4.png" alt="Payara 5" title="Payara 5" /></p><p>Pick the home directory for Java 8</p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/py6.png" alt="Payara 5" title="Payara 5" /></p><p>Finally, go to server properties and change Java Platform<br/><img src="/images/posts/nb9/py7.png" alt="Payara 5" title="Payara 5" /></p><p>At this time, it seem that NetBeans should be running on Java 8 too, otherwhise you won't be able to retrieve server's configuration and logs, <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/comment/4948#comment-4948">there is a similar report on Eclipse Plugin</a>.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/py8.png" alt="Payara 5" title="Payara 5" /></p><h2>Test 3: Glassfish 5 and Payara 5 on Java 8 (NetBeans) and Java 8 (App server platform)</h2><p>Finally, I configured NetBeans to use JDK 8 as NetBeans JDK, for this, you sould edit <code>etc/netbeans.conf</code> file and point the <code>netbeans_jdkhome</code> variable to JDK 8, since I'm using jenv to manage JVM environments the right value is <code>netbeans_jdkhome=&quot;/Users/tuxtor/.jenv/versions/1.8&quot;</code></p><p>With this NetBeans 9 is able to run Payara 5 and Glassfish 5 as expected:</p><p><img src="/images/posts/nb9/py9.png" alt="Payara 5" title="Payara 5" /></p><p>I'm Still not sure about TomEE, OpenLiberty, WebSphere and WebLogic, but it seems like it would be a matter of hacking a litle bit on JDK versions.</p><p>Long live to NetBeans and Jakarta EE!</p></p>
        <a href="../blog/2018/2018-06-18-javaee7-javaee8-backward-compatibility.html"><h1>Testing JavaEE backward and forward compatibility with Servlet, JAX-RS, Batch and Eclipse MicroProfile</h1></a>
        <p>18 June 2018</p>
        <p><p>One of the most interesting concepts that made Java EE (and Java) appealing for the enterprise is its <strong>great backward compatibility</strong>, ensuring that years of investment in R&amp;D could be reused in future developments.</p><p>Neverthless one of the least understood facts is that <strong>Java EE in the end is a set of curated APIs that could be extendend and improved</strong> with additional EE-based APIs -e.g Eclipse MicroProfile, DeltaSpike- and vendor-specific improvements -e.g. Hazelcast on Payara, Infinispan on Wildfly-.</p><p>In this article I'll try to elaborate a reponse for a recent question in my development team:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it possible to implement a new artifact that uses MicroProfile API within Java EE 7? May I use this artifact also in a Java EE 8 Server?</p>
</blockquote><p>To answer this question, I prepared a <strong>POC to demonstrate Java EE capabilities</strong>.</p><h2>Is Java EE backward compatible? Is it safe to assume a clean migration from EE 7 to EE 8?</h2><p>One of the most pervasive rules in IT is "if ain't broke, don't fix it", however the <strong>broke is pretty relative in regards of security, bugs and features</strong>.</p><p>Commonly, <strong>security vunlerabilities and regular bugs are patched through vendor specific updates in Java EE</strong>, retaining the feature compatibility through EE API level, hence this kind of updates are considered safer and should be applied proactively.</p><p>However, once a new EE versiÃ³n is on the streets, <strong>each vendor publish it's product calendar</strong>, being responsable of the future updates and it's expected that any Java EE user will update his stack (or perish :) ).</p><p>In this line Java EE has a complete set of <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/CompatibilityRequirements">requrimentes and backward compatibility instructions, for vendors, spec leads and contributors</a>, this is specially important considering that we receive on every version of Java EE:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New APIs (like Batch in EE 7 or JSON-B in EE 8)</li>
  <li>APIs that simply don't change and are included in the next EE versiÃ³n (like Batch in EE 8)</li>
  <li>APIs with minor updates (Bean Validation in EE 8)</li>
  <li>APIS with new features and interfaces (reactive client in JAX-RS EE 8)</li>
</ul><p>According to compatibility requirements, if your code retains and implements only EE standard code you receive source-code compatibility, binary compatibility and behaviour compatibility for any application that uses a previous version of the specificiation, at least that's the idea.</p><h2>Creating a "complex" implementation</h2><p>To test this assumption I've prepared a POC that implements</p>
<ul>
  <li>Servlets (updated in EE 8)</li>
  <li>JAX-RS (updated in EE 8)</li>
  <li>JPA (minor update in EE 8)</li>
  <li>Batch (does not change in EE 8)</li>

        <p>04 June 2018</p>
        <p><p>Some days ago I had the opportunity/obligation to setup a brand new Linux(Gentoo) development box, hence to make it "enjoyable" <strong>I prepared a back to basics tutorial on how to setup a working environment</strong>.</p><h1>Requirements</h1><p>In order to setup a complete Java EE development box, you need at least:</p><p>1- Working JDK installation and environment<br/>2- IDE/text editor<br/>3- Standalone application server if your focus is "monolithic"</p><p>Due personal preferences I choose</p><p>1- OpenJDK on Gentoo Linux (Icedtea bin build)<br/>2- Eclipse for Java EE developers<br/>3- Payara 5</p><h1>Installing OpenJDK</h1><p>Since this is a distribution dependent step, you could follow tutorials on <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/install/">Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian</a> and many more distributions if you need to. At this time, <strong>most application servers have Java 8 as target due new Java-LTS version scheme</strong>, as in the case of Payara.</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/00.png" data-lightbox="Gentoo" title="Gentoo" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/00.png"><br/></a></p><p>For Gentoo Linux you could get a new OpenJDK setup by installing <a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-java/icedtea">dev-java/icedtea</a> for the source code version and <a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-java/icedtea-bin">dev-java/icedtea-bin</a> for the precompiled version.</p>
<pre><code>emerge dev-java/icedtea-bin
</code></pre><h2>Is OpenJDK a good choice for my need?</h2><p>Currently <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/update-and-faq-on-the-java-se-release-cadence">Oracle has plans to free up all enterprise-commercial JDK features</a>. In a near future the differences between OracleJDK and OpenJDK should be zero.</p><p>In this line, Red Hat and other big players have been offering OpenJDK as the standard JDK in Linux distributions, <strong>working flawlessly for many enterprise grade applications</strong>.</p><h1>Eclipse for Java EE Developers</h1><p>After a complete revamp of websites GUI, you could go directly to <a href="https://eclipse.org">eclipse.org</a> website and download Eclipse IDE. </p><p>Eclipse offers collections of plugins denominated <em>Packages</em>, <strong>each package is a collection of common plugins aimed for a particular development need</strong>. Hence to simplify the process you could download directly Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/01.png" data-lightbox="Eclipse" title="Eclipse" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/01.png"><br/></a></p><p>On Linux, you will download a .tar.gz file, hence you should uncompress it on your preferred directory.</p>
<pre><code>tar xzvf eclipse-jee-oxygen-3a-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>Finally, you could execute the IDE by entering the <em>bin</em> directory and launching <code>eclipse</code> binary.</p>
<pre><code>cd eclipse/bin
./eclipse
</code></pre><p>The result should be a brand new Eclipse IDE.</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/03.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Pick font" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/03.png"><br/></a></p><h1>Payara</h1><p>You could grab a fresh copy of Payara by visiting <a href="https://payara.fish">payara.fish</a> website. </p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/02.png" data-lightbox="Payara" title="Payara" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/02.png"><br/></a></p><p>From Payara's you will receive a zipfile that again you should uncompress in your preferred directory.</p>
<pre><code>unzip payara-5.181.zip
</code></pre><p>Finally, you could add Payara's bin directory to PATH variable in order to use <code>asadmin</code> command from any CLI. You could achieve this by using ~/.bashrc file. For example if you installed Payara at ~/opt/ the complete instruction is:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;PATH=$PATH:~/opt/payara5/bin&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
</code></pre><h1>Integration between Eclipse and Payara</h1><p>After unzipping Payara you are ready to integrate the app server in your Eclipse IDE.</p><p>Recently and due Java/Jakarta EE transition, <a href="https://blog.payara.fish/payara-tools-unlocks-eclipse-for-payara-5">Payara Team has prepared a new integration plugin compatible with Payara 5</a>. In the past you would also use Glassfish Developer Tools with Payara, but <strong>this is not possible anymore</strong>.</p><p>To install it, simply grab the following button on your Eclipse Window, and follow wizard steps.</p><p><a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=4014208" class="drag" title="Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client"><img typeof="foaf:Image" class="img-responsive" src="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.png" alt="Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client" /></a></p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/w1.png" data-lightbox="pwizard" title="pwizard" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/w1.png"><br/></a></p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/w2.png" data-lightbox="pwizard2" title="pwizard" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/w2.png"><br/></a></p><p>In the final step you will be required to restart Eclipse, after that you still need to add the application server. <strong>Go to the Servers tab and click create a new server</strong>:</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/ns0.png" data-lightbox="ns0" title="ns0" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/ns0.png"><br/></a></p><p>Select Payara application server:</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/ns1.png" data-lightbox="ns1" title="ns1" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/ns1.png"><br/></a></p><p>Find Payara's install location and JDK location (corresponding to ~/opt/payara5 and /opt/icedtea-bin on my system):</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/ns2.png" data-lightbox="ns2" title="ns2" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/ns2.png"><br/></a></p><p>Configure Payara's domain, user and password.</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/ns3.png" data-lightbox="ns3" title="ns3" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/ns3.png"><br/></a></p><p>In the end, you will have Payara server available for deployment:</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/ns4.png" data-lightbox="ns4" title="ns4" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/ns4.png"><br/></a></p><h1>Test the demo environment</h1><p>It's time to give it a try. <strong>We could start a new application with a Java EE 8 archetype</strong>, one of my favorites is Adam Bien's <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.airhacks/javaee8-essentials-archetype">javaee8-essentials-archetype</a>, wich provides you an opinionated essentials setup.</p><p>First, create a new project and select a new Maven Project:</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/arch0.png" data-lightbox="arch0" title="arch0" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/arch0.png"><br/></a></p><p>In Maven's window you could search by name any archetype in Maven central, however you should wait a little bit for synchronization between Eclipse and Maven.</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara5/arch1.png" data-lightbox="arch1" title="arch1" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/payara5/arch1.png"><br/></a></p><p>If waiting is not your thing.

        <a href="../blog/2018/2018-03-14-Empty-Reports-Jasper-Reports.html"><h1>Fixing missing data on Jasper Reports with community Linux distros</h1></a>
        <p>14 March 2018</p>
        <p><p>. . . or why my report is half empty in Centos 7.</p><p>One of the most common and least emotional tasks in any enterprise software is to produce reports. However after many years today I got <strong>my first "serious bug" in Jasper Reports.</strong></p><h1>The problem</h1><p>My development team is composed by a mix of Ubuntu and Mac OS workstations, hence we could consider that we use user-friendly environments. Between many applications, we have in maintenance mode a not-so small accounting module which produces a considerable amount of reports. This applications is running (most of the times) on Openshift (Red Hat) platforms or on-premise (also Red Hat).</p><p>A recent deployment was carried over a headless(pure cli) CentOS 7 fresh install and after deploying application on the app server, all reports presented the following issue:</p><p>Good report, Red Hat, Mac Os, Ubuntu<br/><a href="/images/posts/jasper/goodreport.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Good Report" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/jasper/goodreport.png"><br/></a></p><p>Bad report, Centos 7<br/><a href="/images/posts/jasper/badreport.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Bad Report" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/jasper/badreport.png"><br/></a></p><p>At first sight both reports are working and equal, however <strong>in the Centos 7 version, all quantities disappeared</strong> and the only "meaningful" log message related to fonts was:</p>
<blockquote><p>[org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanDefinitionReader] (default task-1) Loading XML bean definitions from URL [vfs:/content/erp-ear.ear/core-web.war/WEB-INF/lib/DynamicJasper-core-fonts-1.0.jar/fonts<br/>/fonts1334623843090.xml]</p>
</blockquote><h1>Fonts in Java</h1><p>After many unsuccessful tests like deploying a new application server version, I learnt a little bit about fonts in the Java virtual machine and Jasper Reports.</p><p>According to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/intl/font.html">Oracle official</a> documentation, you basically have four rules while using fonts in Java, being:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Java supports only TTF and Postscript type 1 fonts</li>
  <li>The only font family included in JDK is Lucida</li>
  <li>If not Lucida JDK will depend on operating system fonts</li>
  <li>Java applications will fallback to the sans/serif default font if the required font is not present on the system</li>
</ol><p>And if you are a Jaspersoft Studio, it makes easy for you to pick Microsoft's True Type fonts</p><p><a href="/images/posts/jasper/pickfont.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Pick font" ><br/> <img class="img-fluid" src="/images/posts/jasper/pickfont.png"><br/></a></p><h1>My CentOS 7 solution</h1><p>Of course Jasper Reports has <a href="https://community.jaspersoft.com/wiki/custom-font-font-extension">support for embedding fonts</a>, however report's font was not Lato, Roboto or Sage, <strong>it was the omnipresent Verdana</strong> part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web">"Core fonts for the web"</a> from Microsoft, not included in most Unix variant <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/solaris/truetype-fonts-v2">due license restrictions</a>.</p><p>Let's assume that nowadays MS Core Fonts are a gray area and you are actually able to install these by using repackaged versions, like mscorefonts2 at sourceforge.</p><p>In CentOS is easy as 1) install dependencies,</p>
<pre><code>yum install curl cabextract xorg-x11-font-utils fontconfig
</code></pre><p>2) download the <a href="http://mscorefonts2.sourceforge.net/">repackaged fonts</a></p>
<pre><code>wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mscorefonts2/rpms/msttcore-fonts-2.1-1.noarch.rpm
</code></pre><p>3) and install the already available rpm file</p>
<pre><code>yum install msttcore-fonts-2.1-1.noarch.rpm
</code></pre><p>With this, all reports were fixed. I really hope that you were able to found this post before trying anything else.</p></p>

        <p><p>Yup it's the time of the year when everybody writes about yearly adventures.</p><p>This year was one of the best for my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderlust">wanderlust</a> spirit, basically due opportunities that I received as member of the global Java community, hence I wanna do a little recap of my Java year in my academic and professional journey, so far Java has been the strongest community I've ever participated. This is probably the year where I made most Java-related friends.</p><p>As always Java community is awesome and <strong>I wanna start this post saying thank you</strong> to all the people that made this possible, I really hope that my presentations, tutorials and workshops were at least at the same level of your expectations, I'm always trying to improve the quality and any feedback is more than welcome.</p><p>Let's start with the highlights recap . . .</p><h2>January</h2><p>January was an interesting month, <strong>my first MOOC collaboration -<a href="https://www.repelisplus.com/v/la-liga-de-la-justicia-a/">Java Fundamentals for Android Development</a>- was published in partnership with Galileo University</strong>. Hence I became an official <a href="https://www.edx.org/bio/victor-orozco">Edx instructor</a>, with Edx profile and everything.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3KU6yuWNqU" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>I really think that course quality could be improved, however feedback was better than I expected. I hope to collaborate in another MOOC in the near future, the simple act to prepare a course in a foreign language for an Edx Micromaster was a truly learning experience that I wanna repeat.</p><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/java-fundamentals-android-development-galileox-caad001x-2">MOOC will run again this year</a>, motivated by good reception . . . I guess/hope :).</p><h2>February</h2><p>In February <strong>I discovered my second favorite Java conference</strong>.

        <p>28 September 2017</p>
        <p><p><a href="/images/posts/java9fedora26/duke9.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Java 9" ><br/> <img src="/images/posts/java9fedora26/duke9.png"><br/></a></p><p>Yey! It's time to celebrate the general availability of Java 9.</p><p>Since I'm <strong>the guy in charge of breaking the things before everyone else in the company</strong>, I've been experimenting with JDK 9 and Fedora 26 Workstation, hence this quick guide about installing Oracle JDK 9 using the "Fedora Way".</p><h1>Getting the JDK</h1><p>As always when a JDK reaches general availability, you could <strong>download a Java Developer Kit from Oracle website</strong>.</p><p>Here <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a></p><p>Conveniently <strong>Oracle offers a .rpm package</strong> that it's supposed to work with any "Hat" distribution. This guide is focused on that installer.</p><h1>Installing the new JDK</h1><p>After downloading the rpm, <strong>you could install it as any other rpm</strong>, at the time of writing this tutorial, the rpm didn't required any other dependency (or any dependency not available in Fedora)</p>
<pre><code>sudo rpm -ivh jdk-9_linux-x64_bin.rpm
</code></pre><p>This command was executed as super user.</p><h1>Configuring the JDK</h1><p>"Hat" distributions come with a handy tool called <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Alternatives">alternatives</a>, as the name suggests it handles the alternatives for the system, in this case the default JVM and compiler.</p><p>First, set the alternative for the <code>java</code> command</p>
<pre><code>sudo alternatives config --java
</code></pre><p>It will list the "Red Hat packaged" JVM's installed on the system, <strong>for instance this is the output in my system (Oracle JDK 8, Oracle JDK 9, OpenJDK 8)</strong>:</p><p><a href="/images/posts/java9fedora26/alternativesjvm.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Java Alternatives" ><br/> <img src="/images/posts/java9fedora26/alternativesjvm.png"><br/></a></p><p>Later, you should also pick a compiler alternative</p>
<pre><code>sudo alternatives config --javac
</code></pre><h1>Configuring JShell REPL</h1><p>JShell is one of the coolest features in Java 9, <strong>being the first official REPL to be included</strong>. However and since it's the first time that the binary is available in the system, it cannot be selected as alternative unless you create it manually.</p><p>First, locate the JDK install directory, Oracle JDK is regularly located at <code>/usr/java</code>, being in my system.</p><p><a href="/images/posts/java9fedora26/jdklist.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="JDK List" ><br/> <img src="/images/posts/java9fedora26/jdklist.png"><br/></a></p><p>As any other JVM binary program, JShell will be located at <code>bin</code> directory, hence to create an alternative (and consequently to be prepared for other Java 9 options . . . and to include the executable in the path):</p>
<pre><code>sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/jshell jshell /usr/java/jdk-9/bin/jshell
</code></pre><p>From now on you could use jshell on any regular shell, just <strong>see my first Java-9 hello world, it looks beautiful :-)</strong>.</p><p><a href="/images/posts/java9fedora26/hello9.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Java 9 Hello World" ><br/> <img src="/images/posts/java9fedora26/hello9.png"><br/></a></p></p>
        <a href="../blog/2017/2017-09-04-Java-Cloud-Day-MÃ©xico-2017.html"><h1>Java Cloud Day MÃ©xico 2017 trip report</h1></a>
        <p>04 September 2017</p>
        <p><p>I'm not accustomed to do "trip reports" of conferences, but I think this conference deserves the report.</p><p>Java Cloud Day 2017 was the <strong>result of a dream from the JEspaÃ±ol community</strong>, a simple one in phrase but very difficult to achieve "unite Java Leaders from Spanish speaking countries in Latin America", dream that started three years ago. Although I'm not one of the "original members", last year I joined the effort after some pub-discussions in Java One.</p><p>Honor to whom honor is owed, one of the <strong>key sponsors who made this possible was <a href="https://twitter.com/certificatic?lang=en">CertificaTIC</a></strong>, a mexican Java-Oracle certification services provider who believed in the project and put a lot of resources for the event. Adrian, Mirza and the whole team . . . you rock!</p><h1>The previous virtual conference</h1><p>The event as a whole was carried as two conferences. The first leg called <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/EventosJEspanol/">"conferencia virtual JEspaÃ±ol"</a> with VirtualJUG-Like conferences but in Spanish</strong> with speakers from Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Colombia, being the first of its kind.</p><h1>Java Cloud Day Mexico 2017</h1><p>And the day finally came . . .</p><p>Celebrated in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the computer science program in the mythical <a href="http://computacion.ingenieria.unam.mx/">Universidad Nacional Autonoma de MÃ©xico (UNAM)</a>, <strong>the event was a huge success</strong>.</p><p>With talks from Java Champions, Oracle Developer Champions, Oracle ACE, JUG Leaders, Oracle Technology Network and "Javatars", this is the biggest IT Spanish-speaking event I've ever attended, <strong>raising the bar for all of us in our next events.</strong></p><p>Kudos, bitcoins, stamina, japanese ki and whatever is valuable for all participants and speakers. Events like these are my favorite since (and taking a famous phrase from DevNexus) this was an <strong>event from developers, by developers for developers</strong>.</p><h1>The pictures</h1><p>Some selected pictures from the event, dinner, and Teotihuacan.</p>

        <a href="../blog/2017/2017-08-25-Payara41-Quick-Install-CentoOS-7.html"><h1>Payara 4.1 install guide on CentOS 7</h1></a>
        <p>25 August 2017</p>
        <p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara/payara.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Payara" ><br/> <img src="/images/posts/payara/payara.png"><br/></a></p><p>In this "back to basics tutorial" I'll try to explain <strong>how to install properly Payara 4.1 on Centos 7</strong> (it should be fine for Red Hat, Oracle Unbreakable Linux and other *hat distributions).</p><p>Why not Docker, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, . . .?. Sometimes the best solution is the easiest :).</p><h1>Pre-requisites</h1><p>The only software requirement to run Payara is to <strong>have a JDK installed</strong>. CentOS offers a custom OpenJDK build called <a href="https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless-1.8.0.102-4.b14.el7.x86_64.rpm.html">"headless"</a> that doesn't offer support for audio and video, perfect for cli environments.</p><p>You can install it with Yum.</p>
<pre><code>yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless
</code></pre><h1>Create a Payara user</h1><p>As mentioned in the official <a href="https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/documentation">Glassfish documentation</a>, it is convenient to <strong>run your application server in a dedicated user</strong> for security and administrative reasons.</p>
<pre><code>adduser payara
</code></pre><p>Although you could be tempted to create a no-login, no-shell user, Payara saves many preferences in user's home directory and <strong>the shell/login is actually needed to execute administrative commands like <code>asadmin</code></strong>.</p><h1>Download and unzip Payara</h1><p>Payara is hosted at Amazon S3, please double check this link on <a href="https://www.payara.fish/">Payara's website</a>, for this guide I'm installing Payara at server's <code>/opt</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code>cd /opt
wget https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/payara.fish/Payara+Downloads/Payara+4.1.2.173/payara-4.1.2.173.zip
unzip payara-4.1.2.173.zip
</code></pre><p>You should execute the above commands as super-user, after that <strong>you should change permissions for the Payara directory before any domain start</strong>. Otherwise you won't be able to use the server with <code>payara</code> user</p>
<pre><code>chown -R payara:payara payara41
</code></pre><h1>systemd unit</h1><p>Centos 7 uses systemd as init system, consequently it is possible and actually quite easy to create a <strong>systemd unit to start, stop and restart Payara default domain</strong><br/>.<br/>First, create a file that represents Payara systemd unit.</p>
<pre><code>/etc/systemd/system/payara.service
</code></pre><p>And add the following content:</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description = Payara Server v4.1
After = syslog.target network.target

[Service]
User=payara
ExecStart = /usr/bin/java -jar /opt/payara41/glassfish/lib/client/appserver-cli.jar start-domain
ExecStop = /usr/bin/java -jar /opt/payara41/glassfish/lib/client/appserver-cli.jar stop-domain
ExecReload = /usr/bin/java -jar /opt/payara41/glassfish/lib/client/appserver-cli.jar restart-domain
Type = forking

[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
</code></pre><p>Note that Payara administration is achieved with <code>payara</code> user. You could personalize it to fit your needs.</p><p>Optionally you could enable the service to start with the server and/or after server reboots.</p>
<pre><code>systemctl enable payara
</code></pre><p>Check if all is working properly with the systemd standard commands</p>
<pre><code>systemctl start payara
systemctl restart payara
systemctl stop payara
</code></pre><h1>Payara user PATH</h1><p>As Payara and Glassfish users already know, <strong>most administrative tasks in Payara application server are achieved by using cli commands</strong> like <code>asadmin</code>. Hence it is convenient to have all tools available in our administrative <code>payara</code> user.</p><p>First log-in as Payara user, if you didn't assign a password for the user you could switch to this user using <code>su</code> as root user.</p>
<pre><code>su payara
</code></pre><p>Later you shoud create or edit the <code>.bashrc</code> file for the Payara user, the most common location being user's home directory.</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/payara
vim .bashrc
</code></pre><p>And add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/payara41/glassfish/bin
</code></pre><h1>Final result</h1><p>If your setup was done properly you should obtain an environment like in the following screenshot:</p><p><a href="/images/posts/payara/payarafinish.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Payara Centos 7" ><br/> <img src="/images/posts/payara/payarafinish.png"><br/></a></p><p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm able to use systemd commands</li>
  <li>It actually restarded since PID changed after <code>systemd restart</code></li>
  <li><code>asadmin</code> works and displays properly the running domain</li>
</ul></p>

<pre><code>&gt;Mision: Help universities, high schools and IT development centers with Java-centered conferences in order to update IT knowledge in the not-so developed regions of Guatemala

&gt;Vision: Travel through Guatemala and have fun while promoting our conference and Java
</code></pre><h1>Why is this important?</h1><p>Guatemala is one of the Central American countries with less <strong>college graduates</strong>, only 10% of the population could access to college education and only 10% of that population (hence 1%) actually gets a degree, with the addition that <strong>most of the people choose a non-STEM degree</strong>.</p><p>Anyways as most of you probably know, you actually don't need a degree to be a rockstar in Software Development, and for this many people in the country is <strong>gaining interest in Computer Science</strong> in order to get better job opportunities and GuateJUG is glad to be a part of that change.</p><h1>The tour</h1><p>To finance the tour expenses we created an <strong>inverted call for papers</strong>, any group, association, university, high school could choose between a bunch of speakers and a fixed set of talks, being:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maria Castillo (<a href="http://twitter.com/marycoder">@marycoder</a>)</li>
  <li>Jorge Cajas (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jac_Mota">@jac_mota</a>)</li>

  <li>Me (<a href="http://twitter.com/tuxtor">@tuxtor</a>)</li>
</ul><p>GuateJUG put the time plus experience and they put the venue and accomodation. Contrary what we initially expected (and sadly with most success than our yearly conference), GuateJUG tour was a hit. We successfully participated in many talks in the following cities:</p>

<pre><code>${JBDEVSTUDIO_HOME}/studio/jbdevstudio.app/Contents/Eclipse/jbdevstudio.ini
</code></pre><p>Being the default location:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/studio/jbdevstudio.app/Contents/Eclipse/jbdevstudio.ini

I must say thanks to the people that made this trip possible, special acknowledgments to Nichole Scott from Oracle, my peers at <a href="http://www.nabenik.com">Nabenik</a> that gratefully sponsored my trip and the Guatemala Java User Group for allowing me to take advantage of the Java One ticket :-D.</p><p>I think that every techie has a list of conferences to attend before die, as 2015 my top five is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JavaOne (2015 finally)</li>
  <li>Gentoo Miniconf</li>
  <li>OSCON</li>
  <li>Forum Internacional de Sofware Livre - FISL (2013 as a speaker yey!)</li>
  <li>ConvenciÃ³n de Informatica Guatemala (2005 - now dead, but it made the list for nostalgia)</li>
</ul><p>Although I had some health issues due stress, Java One and San Francisco were lifetime experiences. As each conference I've attended, it has its goods and bads but in general <strong>you can feel a strong sense of community between attendants</strong>, from Pivotal to Red Hat (and Microsoft), from the peer that shares a beer with you and turns out to be a Java Champion to the people that speaks another languages with you, Java One is about community making awesome things in IT. Programming languages aren't eternal but I can state that the differential factor that raised 20-year languages like Java and JavaScript among the others is the community.</p><p>Random photos:</p>

Characterized by pragmatism, openness and community structure since its inception, GuateJUG became one of the strongest user groups in Central America, the integration between industry, academia, Open Source communities, Free Software communities and HR people looking for the next generation of developers is unique.</p><p>As a special occasion <strong>we held a traditional birthday celebration</strong>, including birthday cake and mexican piÃ±atas. It was great to share words with some old friends and meet new IT enthusiasts, as a matter of fact we also sang "Happy birthday Java and happy birthday GuateJUG".</p><p>Video and some more random photos:</p><p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7o0XShv79E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><br/></p>

</code></pre><h1>Book details</h1><p><strong>I received this book as a part of the now dead O'Reilly users group program</strong>. When I asked for this book I was specially interested due comments from my development peers . . . and most importantly because I was in the middle of a Software Architecture definition.</p><p>I'm writing this review after 7 months of using it on daily basis, basically because our development stack is composed by AngularJS on the front-end and JavaEE 7 on the back-end (with a huge bias to the Hat company). At the office we have a small books collection (because IT books are pretty dead after five years), and <strong>Aurun's book is our prefered book</strong> for the "Java EE 7 rescue kit".</p><p>If I have to choose <strong>two adjectives for this book I must say "quick and versatile"</strong>, this book deserves all of its fame because it has the balance between a good reference book and a user friendly introductory book, most of the IT books don't achieve it.</p><p>I don't wanna copy the index page but I have the following <strong>favorite chapters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Servlets</li>
  <li>RESTFul Web Services</li>
  <li>SOAP Web Services</li>
  <li>JSON Processing</li>
  <li>Enterprise Java Beans</li>
  <li>Context and Dependency Injection</li>
  <li>Bean Validation</li>
  <li>Java Transactions</li>
  <li>Java Persistence</li>
</ul><p>Most of the book samples are based on Glassfish, and is easy to guess why looking at the publication date. However, talking from my true-heavy-metal-monkey-developer-architect experience, <strong>this book uses only pure JavaEE 7 apis</strong> and I've been able to run/use the samples on Wildfly without issues.</p><p>For those that are looking a good book for JavaEE 7 development, on any of the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/compatibility-jsp-136984.html">certified Java EE 7 servers</a> <strong>this is a must</strong>.</p><h1>Highlights</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Good balance between tutorial and reference.</li>
  <li>Few content compared to the Java EE Tutorial but still in the point.</li>
  <li>The samples should work on any Java EE 7 server.</li>
</ul><h1>Could be better</h1>
<ul>
  <li>WebSockets section is small in relation to the other chapters, it feels incomplete.</li>
  <li>The cover brings to my mind the good old days when Glassfish was that application server that everybody is talking.</li>

Easy, with the right sponsors and contacts :).</p><p><strong>An special acknowledgment</strong> for the people that made this first leg possible:<br/>- Jorge Cajas (Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala)<br/>- Dhaby Xiloj (Universidad Rafael Landivar - Quetzaltenango)<br/>- Rene Alvarado (Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala - Chiquimula)</p><p>In this first leg (not the only one . . . I hope) GuateJUG team went <strong>from the center of the country to the east and later to the west</strong>, like in this ugly map:</p><p><a href="/images/posts/guatejugtour2015/map.png" target="_blank"><br/> <img src="/images/posts/guatejugtour2015/map.png" alt="GuateJUG Tour" style="width: 300px;"/><br/></a></p><p>Covering the following topics</p><h2>First conference</h2><p>Place: Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala - Guatemala City<br/>* Java 8: Functional programming principles (me)<br/>* 20 years of Java (Wences Arana - DebianGt)</p><h2>Second conference</h2><p>Place: Universidad Rafael Landivar - Quetzaltenango<br/>* Source code control with Git - (me)</p><h2>Third conference</h2><p>Place: Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala - Chiquimula<br/>* HTML5 applications with Java EE 7 and AngularJS - (me)<br/>* Android 101 - (Mercedes Wyss - GuateJUG)</p><p>Random photos:</p>

</div><p>Some years ago <strong>I did a similar tour with the FLOSS community in my college years</strong>. The sensation of going back to the same cities, hanging out with good old friends and other new friends is always pleasant.</p><p>Every time anyone asks me why I do this, <strong>I have the same answer</strong> "why not? At least each time I know the country a little bit more :)". </p><p>With this I'm in the best mood for Java Day Guatemala and most importantly to attend <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">Java One 2015</a> willing to collaborate with some User Groups activities, I hope to see many of you in both conferences.</p></p>

        <p>26 September 2015</p>
        <p><p>In <a href="http://www.guate-jug.net">GuateJUG</a> <strong>we arrived to our fifth year</strong>, consequently I must start this post with a "thanks to everybody that made this possible (developers, advocates, supporters, sponsors, friends, family, and other-UG)".</p><p><strong>This year has been a special year for GuateJUG</strong> and Java in general, in February we were very excited about being featured at <a href="http://gtts.ehu.es/WDW/biblio/JavaMagazine/javamagazine20150102-dl.pdf">Java Magazine</a> (a little step for .gt developers, a great step for our user group), and as every inch of the web knows 2015 is the year of the 20 years of Java, another anniversary that came in hand to believe that 2015 is the year of Java reborn.</p><p>Hence, at GuateJUG we added to our regular activities a conference circuit called <strong>GuateJUG Tour</strong>.</p><p><a href="/images/posts/gtour2015.png" target="_blank"><br/> <img src="/images/posts/gtour2015.png" alt="GuateJUG Tour" style="width: 300px;"/><br/></a></p><p>As many of our activities, this is some kind of spontaneous tour, hence <strong>we'll be adding dates as new cities are confirmed</strong> (Guatemala is a small country so it's possible to confirm in very short notice).</p><p>The tour started on September 26 and I'm confirmed as a speaker in three cities, so <strong>I'll be collecting my slides in this post for quick reference</strong> :).</p><h1>Java 8: MÃ¡s funcional que nunca</h1><p><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/30AXtCu2ARI9hD" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/tuxtor/java-8-ms-funcional-que-nunca" title="Java 8: MÃ¡s funcional que nunca" target="_blank">Java 8: MÃ¡s funcional que nunca</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/tuxtor" target="_blank">VÃ­ctor Orozco</a></strong> </div></p><h1>Git 101 (with Java)</h1><p><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/H4g9lRHrc63bzj" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/tuxtor/introduccin-a-git-git-101" title="IntroducciÃ³n a Git (Git 101)" target="_blank">IntroducciÃ³n a Git (Git 101)</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/tuxtor" target="_blank">VÃ­ctor Orozco</a></strong> </div></p><h1>Aplicaciones HTML5 con AngularJS y JavaEE</h1><p><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/EVtupsoyepJrX3" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/tuxtor/inciando-con-angularjs-y-javaee-7" title="Inciando con AngularJS y JavaEE 7" target="_blank">Inciando con AngularJS y JavaEE 7</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/tuxtor" target="_blank">VÃ­ctor Orozco</a></strong> </div></p></p>
        <a href="../blog/2015/Welcome.html"><h1>Welcome</h1></a>
        <p>08 August 2015</p>
        <p><p>Hi, If you're reading this probably you are one of my few twitter followers, so thanks for your visit. For those that don't know me I wanna share a little story with you :).</p><p>As an IT guy, I started my main website/blog <a href="http://tuxtor.shekalug.org/">El abismo de tux (in spanish)</a> in 2006 during my college years, mostly as an experiment that grew as the blog phenoma exploded, gaining great experiences like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Being featured in a nation-wide newspaper;</li>
  <li>Being invited to morning talk shows due my tech/politics rants;</li>
  <li>Getting opportunities like my first job using my tech blog as a "certification" of my expertise in Unix and Java.</li>
</ul><p>So . . . what's the point of starting a new website in 2015?</p><p>I consider my old blog as a chronological reflection of my life experiences, like my stupidity at college, my involvement in FLOSS communities, my musical taste, EVERYTHING that I could talk about technology, politics, society, academia, the life in the countries where I've lived (Guatemala, Brazil), and in recent years using it as an scratchpad of my day to day coding.</p><p>During this year at <a href="http://www.nabenik.com">Nabenik</a>, while I was struggling to improve my coding skills I noticed that most if not all the times I search for tech content exclusively in English, and I've noticed also a debacle on my readers due the change of focus at my old blog. because I simply killed some topics that I don't care anymore (politics, Free Software as a social movement, the country where I live), so I've decided that is time to put the "Tux Abyss" in mantainance mode.</p><p>Killing a website is more difficult than it looks, specially a website that has been online since 2006, however at this point of my life/carreer I'd like to share deeper facts and knowlege about fewer topics, specially:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gentoo Linux and Unix in General</li>
  <li>JVM Languages (Java, JavaScript)</li>
</ul><p>That's why I'm welcoming you to "The J*", the name is inspired in three facts</p>
<ul>
  <li>I write code in JVM Languages (specially Java) and JavaScript on daily basis</li>
  <li>I was born in June</li>
  <li>The second name of a child that means a lot to me starts with J</li>
</ul><p>For this site and considering my past experiences with Wordpress and Jekyll . . . I decided to try <a href="http://jbake.org/">JBake</a>, mainly because I'm familiar with Gradle, and for me is easier to write posts in markdown. Also because I fell in love with the results at <a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> and <a href="http://www.hawkular.org/">Hawkular</a> to name a few.</p><p>At this time this blog is hosted at GitHub pages being built by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/tuxtor/the-j">Travis-CI</a> with gradle, saving me hosting costs.</p><p>I think that starting a web site in the <a href="http://jacquesmattheij.com/aol-20">AOL 2.0</a> era is some kind of digital rebellion, so please grab a seat and feel free to drop comments :).</p></p>
