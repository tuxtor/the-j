I'm VÃ­ctor Orozco also known as tuxtor, I do code for living and I'm currently living at Guatemala.

I hold a Bsc. in Computer Science and Information Systems from [USAC](http://www.usac.edu.gt) and a Msc. in Computer Science from [UFSM](http://www.ufsm.br/).

Most of my friends consider me as a Java and Gentoo Linux advocate . . . and so do I. 

I'm mostly interested in Natural Languages, Open Source Software, Computer Science (specially Information Security and Social Network Analysis) and Enterpreneurship.

Currently I spend most of my time trying to grow [Nabenik](http://www.nabenik.com) (my own consultancy company) and I'm one of the board members of [GuateJUG](http://www.guate-jug.net).

You can view my professional profile at Linkedin or as plain text :).
