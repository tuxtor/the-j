I'm VÃ­ctor Orozco also known as tuxtor, I do code for living and I'm currently living in Brazil.

I hold a Bsc. in Computer Science and Information Systems from [USAC](http://www.usac.edu.gt) and a Msc. in Computer Science from [UFSM](http://www.ufsm.br/), besides this I hold Oracle Certified Associate and Professional certifications.

Most of my friends consider me as a Java and Gentoo Linux advocate . . . and so do I. In this line I've been college professor, and nowadays I'm a Java Champion, Duke's Choice Award winner (2016), Edx Micromasters instructor.

I'm mostly interested in Natural Languages, Open Source Software, Computer Science (specially Information Security and Social Network Analysis) and Enterpreneurship.
