Book details
============
**I received this book as a part of the now dead O'Reilly users group program**. When I asked for this book I was specially interested due comments from my development peers . . . and most importantly because I was in the middle of a Software Architecture definition.

I'm writing this review after 7 months of using it on daily basis, basically because our development stack is composed by AngularJS on the front-end and JavaEE 7 on the back-end (with a huge bias to the Hat company). At the office we have an small books collection (because IT books are pretty dead after five years), and **Aurun's book is our prefered book** for the "Java EE 7 rescue kit".

If I have to choose **two adjectives for this book I must say "quick and versatile"**, this book deserves all of its fame because it has the balance between a good reference book and a user friendly introductory book, most of the IT books don't achieve it.

I don't wanna copy the index page but I have the following **favorite chapters**:

* Servlets
* RESTFul Web Services
* SOAP Web Services
* JSON Processing
* Enterprise Java Beans
* Context and Dependency Injection
* Bean Validation
* Java Transactions
* Java Persistence

Most of the book samples are based on Glassfish, and is easy to guess why looking at the publication date. However, talking from my true-heavy-metal-monkey-developer-architect experience, **this book uses only pure JavaEE 7 apis** and I've been able to run/use the samples on Wildfly without issues.

For those that are looking a good book for JavaEE 7 development, on any of the [certified Java EE 7 servers](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/compatibility-jsp-136984.html) **this is a must**.

Highlights
==========
* Good balance between tutorial and reference.
* Few content compared to the Java EE Tutorial but still in the point.
* The samples should work on any Java EE 7 server.

Could be better
===============
* WebSockets section is small in relation to the other chapters, it feels incomplete.
* The cover brings to my mind the good old days when Glassfish was that application server that everybody is talking.
