As I described [previously](/blog/2015/GuateJUG-Tour-2015.html), GuateJUG held a conference circuit promoting its yearly conference **[Java Day Guatemala 2015](http://www.guate-jug.net/javaday2015)**.

This activity was motivated by [Java's 20th anniversary](https://community.oracle.com/community/java/javas-20th-anniversary) and specially due **GuateJUG's 5th anniversary**.

So... how do you achieve a tour that traverses Guatemala?. Easy, with the right sponsors and contacts :).

**An special acknowledgment** for the people that made this first leg possible:
- Jorge Cajas (Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala)
- Dhaby Xiloj (Universidad Rafael Landivar - Quetzaltenango)
- Rene Alvarado (Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala - Chiquimula)

In this first leg (not the only one . . . I hope) GuateJUG team went **from the center of the country to the east and later to the west**, like in this ugly map:

Some years ago **I did a similar tour with the FLOSS community in my college years**. The sensation of going back to the same cities, hanging out with good old friends and other new friends is always pleasant.

Every time anyone asks me why I do this, **I have the same answer** "why not? At least each time I know the country a little bit more :)". 

With this I'm in the best mood for Java Day Guatemala and most importantly to attend [Java One 2015](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html) willing to collaborate with some User Groups activities, I hope to see many of you in both conferences.
