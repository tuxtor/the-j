The last quarter of the year is maybe my favorite period of time, since 2012 **I try to attend at least to one "big" conference** and this year won't be an exception. 

For me **conferences are an opportunity** to meet new people, have fun, and of course travel to new/favorite places, and this year I'll have the opportunity to attend two big conferences.

From September 12 to 15 I'll be attending  [WITFOR 2016](http://www.witfor2016.org/) as a member of the guatemalan academic community. Since my Msc. I've missed the serious academic environment, conferences, CFP, basically because my country(Guatemala) is still creating an academic system. Hence **I have to help (a little bit at least)** in my [University](http://www.url.edu.gt/).

Later jumping from one plane to another (literally) I'll travel to attend J1. As I previously stated, J1 was a "TODO in life" I had the opportunity to attend the past year and collaborate with some community activities, however this year(between other good news) [one of my proposals was accepted](https://oracle.rainfocus.com/scripts/catalog/oow16.jsp?search=UGF7869&search.event=javaone), so **I'm trying to be ready to chill-out with some Java community peers and share the things that we are doing in Guatemala's software industry**.

See you at J1 and WITFOR 2016.
