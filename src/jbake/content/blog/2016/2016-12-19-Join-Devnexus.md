[Devnexus](https://devnexus.com/) is probably (and according to this video) **the second biggest Java Conference in United States**, hence one of the top ten Java conferences in America.

Organized by the [Atlanta Java Users Group](http://www.ajug.org/), you could choose between 120+ presentations, 14 tracks and 7 workshops, in order to catch-up with recent topics on Java and Enterprise development world, **a must for any Java Developer looking for knowledge**.

Devenexus 2017 will be my first attendance and **I'm honored to share that one of my presentations was accepted :)**.

In this presentation i'll give a practical introduction to functional/reactive programing in Java for the "street developer" and we'll be **reviewing a list of useful libraries** to make elegant and functional (as in the paradigm) web applications.

Why this and not other conferences?, in my opinion:
- It's held on a cheaper city compared to California conferences
- It's a conference from developers for developers
- Atlanta Jug guys are awesome
- Java still rocks

I hope to see you there
