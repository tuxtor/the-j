I'm not accustomed to do "trip reports" of conferences, but I think this conference deserves the report.

Java Cloud Day 2017 was the **result of a dream from the JEspañol community**, a simple one in phrase but very difficult to achieve "unite Java Leaders from Spanish speaking countries in Latin America", dream that started three years ago. Although I'm not one of the "original members", last year I joined the effort after some pub-discussions in Java One.

Honor to whom honor is owed, one of the **key sponsors who made this possible was [CertificaTIC](https://twitter.com/certificatic?lang=en)**, a mexican Java-Oracle certification services provider who believed in the project and put a lot of resources for the event. Adrian, Mirza and the whole team . . . you rock!

# The previous virtual conference

The event as a whole was carried as two conferences. The first leg called **["conferencia virtual JEspañol"](https://www.facebook.com/pg/EventosJEspanol/) with VirtualJUG-Like conferences but in Spanish** with speakers from Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Colombia, being the first of its kind.

And the day finally came . . .

Celebrated in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the computer science program in the mythical [Universidad Nacional Autonoma de México (UNAM)](http://computacion.ingenieria.unam.mx/), **the event was a huge success**.

With talks from Java Champions, Oracle Developer Champions, Oracle ACE, JUG Leaders, Oracle Technology Network and "Javatars", this is the biggest IT Spanish-speaking event I've ever attended, **raising the bar for all of us in our next events.**

Kudos, bitcoins, stamina, japanese ki and whatever is valuable for all participants and speakers. Events like these are my favorite since (and taking a famous phrase from DevNexus) this was an **event from developers, by developers for developers**.
